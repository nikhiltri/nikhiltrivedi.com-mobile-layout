Nikhiltrivedi.com mobile layout
-------------------------------

This is a Drupal 6 module that uses CSS media queries to restructure the 
layout of my nikhiltrivedi.com for small devices. Most of the work is in the
CSS, but I used a particular strategy to allow for swapping between the mobile 
and desktop version of the site on the fly. More details on the thinking 
behind the technical strategy can be found here:
